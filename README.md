If you would like to compile from scratch or would like to see the changes we made to SPICE, please check the 
[submodule](https://github.com/furkanbiten/SPICE/tree/a8f69f1478faea2d61d94f759ebc2ca112be3111)!

However, if you are pragmatist and just wanna use the code (I feel you!), here is the link to [SPICE.zip](drive.google.com)
