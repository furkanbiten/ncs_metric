# Is An Image Worth Five Sentences? A New Look into Semantics for Image-Text Matching
Welcome! In this repo, you can find the code for [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02623.pdf) published in WACV 2022.

## To those who are curious! (How did you do it?)
### SPICE

If you would like to compile from scratch or would like to see the changes we made to SPICE, please check the 
[submodule](https://github.com/furkanbiten/SPICE/tree/a8f69f1478faea2d61d94f759ebc2ca112be3111)!

However, if you are pragmatist and just wanna use the code (I feel you!), here is the link to download
[SPICE.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U9M-Z44fluvIovdR4DFNd3YyyjNfL702/view?usp=sharing). 

After downloading, unzip the file and run `python get_stanford models` and then run `java -Xmx8G -jar spice-1.0.jar ./example.json` to see if it works. 
This should result in a file called spice_pairwise.csv. 

## To those who are impatient!
